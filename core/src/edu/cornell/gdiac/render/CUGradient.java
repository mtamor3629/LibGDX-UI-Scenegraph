/**
 * This class defines a two color gradient.
 *
 * All gradients, including linear and radial gradients, are variations
 * of (rounded) box gradients. A box gradient is defined by (in terms of
 * largest to smallest data):
 *
 * <ul>
 *    <li>An affine transform (for offset and rotation)</li>
 *    <li>An inner color</li>
 *    <li>An outer color</li>
 *    <li>A size vector of the gradient</li>
 *    <li>A corner radius for the rounded rectangle</li>
 *    <li>A feather factor for the transition speed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Assuming this data is in std140 format, this is a 24 element array of floats.
 * And this is the format that this data is represented in the {@link #getData}
 * method so that it can be passed to a {@link CUUniformBuffer} for improved
 * performance. It is also possible to get access to the individual components
 * of the paint gradient, to pass them to a shader directly (though the transform
 * must be inverted first if it is passed directly).
 *
 * Paint gradients are applied to surfaces in the same way textures are. The
 * gradient is defined on a unit square from (0,0) to (1,1). To be consistent
 * with textures, the origin is at the top right corner. To apply the gradient,
 * the shader should use the texture coordinates of each vertex (or an attribute
 * similar to texture coordinates) combined with the uniforms for this gradient.
 *
 * For {@link CUSpriteBatch} and scene graph compatibility, gradients may be tinted
 * by another color.  This tint is managed separately from the gradient definition.
 *
 * For simplicity we only permit two colors in a gradient.  For multicolored
 * gradients, the shape should be tesellated with multiple gradient values.
